# Regression-Stats

**This project aims at funding the linear regression line and the pearson correlation
coefficient**

Language used: **python**

Note that special funcs and syntax were used:

1. `zip()` function creates a tuple, that contains tuples with x and y coordinates
2. `for - in`, basically golang's `for-range` in python
3. `{:.6f}` or `{:.10f}` is essentially a formatter for integers, to ensure correct significant figures.

Use proper argument length **(pls)**

***To Run The Test:***

1. `chmod u+x linear-stats` after downloading the binary executable
2. `./linear-stats` to generate test data and expected results
3. `python3 linear-soln.py data.txt` to run and compare

Formula for the linear regression line equation (in y = mx + b):
